Quickie polynomial root finder for polynomials with real-valued coefficients.

Not especially well tested yet -- there are very few test cases and all of them are well conditioned at the moment of writing.

I intend to use it for a very specific purpose soon, and just made this implementation quickly in order to get a good starting point for a more well-targeted implementation.
